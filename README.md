# optical-cooling-demo
An Interactive Demostration of Optical Cooling

### Purpose

This optical cooling demo is intended to be a realistic simulation of optical cooling, but scaled so that it can be interactive. The final result should be oriented towards an in-browser demonstration.

### Current status

Right now, two dumbed down models of doppler cooling are shown, and the scaling is such that only a change can be observed over a given period of time.

### TODO

* Adjust scaling for better observation while running program
* Improve method of calculating temperature
* Improve efficiency of calculations to allow for more atoms (or just add more atoms?)
* Give atoms more freedom and appropriately adjust their interactions with photons
* Incorporate more accurate model of trapping

### Dependencies

Ideally, the program should only be reliant on python-tk.
